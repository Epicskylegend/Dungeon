# Dungeon RPG
This is a text based dungeon RPG where you're faced with random enemies that you defeat to obtain experience and level up. The level and health of enemies will scale with that of the player to allow for more challenging combat. These foes have a chance to drop health potions when defeated, but they don't drop frequently, so use your potions wisely. The potions also scale with the level of the player to ensure that they stay useful as you start to level up more and more. Once your health drops to 0, the game will end.
